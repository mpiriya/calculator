# Calculator

**What Works so far**

- divide by 0 gives error

- 2 part operation works (a +,-,/,x b)

- clear button clears

- rounds to not overflow screen

- decimal compatibility

**Issues**

- order of operation such as 1 + 3 * 2 should be 7, not 6

- after equals, set val1 to the result, so that the result can be operated on

- probably a lot more :)

**To Add**

- backspace button

- make it look nice

- keyboard support
